# Version 1.0.3
## BREAKING CHANGES
With this version new entities and device relations are implemented. Coming from a version < 1.0.0 means, that created entities are not longer used or updated by the integration.
I recommend to re-setup the integration by removing and re-installing from the integrations page after updating via HACS.
